URL-RegEx
=========

A Regular Expression for catching URLs and extracting fragments out of them.

``` javascript
RegEx = /\(?\b(?:(http|https|ftp):\/\/)?((?:www.)?[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]+[\.][a-zA-Z]{2,4})(?::(\d*))?(?=[\s\/,\.\)])([\/]{1}[^\s\?]*[\/]{1})*(?:\/?([^\s\n\?\[\]\{\}\#]*(?:(?=\.)){1}|[^\s\n\?\[\]\{\}\.\#]*)?([\.]{1}[^\s\?\#]*)?)?(?:\?{1}([^\s\n\#\[\]\(\)]*))?([\#][^\s\n]*)?\)?/;
```

## How it works?

Match this RegEx against a chunk of text, and catch any URL inside it.
It should work on any programming language that supports Regular Expressions.

You can check [JavaScript example](http://someweblog.com/url-regular-expression-javascript-link-shortener/) of its use.

## URL fragments

It captures 8 groups (plus first group that contains entire URL). If some of them donâ€™t exist in URL, that group will return empty.

1. Entire URL
2. Protocol
3. Domain
4. Port
5. Folders / Paths
6. Page / Filename
7. File extension
8. Parameters
9. Anchor
